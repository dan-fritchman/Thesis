abstract = {Rust is a new programming language for developing reliable and efficient systems. It is designed to support concurrency and parallelism in building applications and libraries that take full advantage of modern hardware. Rust's static type system is safe1 and expressive and provides strong guarantees about isolation, concurrency, and memory safety.Rust also offers a clear performance model, making it easier to predict and reason about program efficiency. One important way it accomplishes this is by allowing fine-grained control over memory representations, with direct support for stack allocation and contiguous record storage. The language balances such controls with the absolute requirement for safety: Rust's type system and runtime guarantee the absence of data races, buffer overflows, stack overflows, and accesses to uninitialized or deallocated memory.},

abstract = {This paper describes LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine),a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelongprogram analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs,by providing high-level information to compilertransformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and inidle time between runs.LLVM defines a common, low-levelcode representation in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form,with several novel features: a simple, language-independenttype-system that exposes the primitives commonly used toimplement high-level language features; an instruction fortyped address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that canbe used to implement the exception handling features ofhigh-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformlyand efficiently.The LLVM compiler framework and coderepresentation together provide a combination of key capabilitiesthat are important for practical, lifelong analysis andtransformation of programs.To our knowledge, no existingcompilation approach provides all these capabilities.We describethe design of the LLVM representation and compilerframework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) thesize and effectiveness of the representation, including thetype information it provides; (b) compiler performance forseveral interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examplesof the benefits LLVM provides for several challengingcompiler problems.},

    Abstract = {Generators are a key component in enabling analog/mixed-signal design automation, reuse, and optimization. Existing generator frameworks suffer from being tightly integrated with commercial tools, having performance limitations, and being difficult to customize to circuits that require different styles of layout. In this thesis, we present Substrate, a new framework for writing analog and mixed-signal generators. Substrate offers high performance, strongly-typed APIs, and a wide set of utilities for schematic entry, layout entry, and functional verification. To provide more compact SRAMs that are easy to integrate into digital flows, we also develop SRAM22, an open-source SRAM generator for the Skywater 130nm open-source process. We describe how SRAM22 utilizes Substrate features to generate compact layout, while retaining the flexibility expected from a generator. SRAM22-generated SRAMs have been integrated into RISC-V cores produced using both open-source and commercial digital tools.}
